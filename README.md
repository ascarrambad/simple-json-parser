# simple-json-parser
A simple JSON parser Iâ€™ve done as an assignment for a class. It's not perfect, it's not garbage.
It recognises a simplified JSON grammar and it is written both in Common Lisp and SWI-Prolog.

There is a readme file in each folder explaining more about the functions and predicates.
